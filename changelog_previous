# This is a big major release, many core modifictations in the script : Optimisation and security.
# cleanup for readability/editablility ==> conf and dat files have changed format and are not retrocompatible.

# Use different .htaccess login/password for each site (use of uuencode in randomness user/pass generation)
# Added support for various config/dat files through simple variable
# Merge all .dat files in a single one - This will render the script more flexible - Done, but now I need to adapt the rest of the script

# When mixing ovh hosted accounts with custom
