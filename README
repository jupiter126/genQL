This script is called genQL, I started developping it at the start of 2010 to backup our websites and mysql databases.

Written by JuPiTeR (Nelson-Jean Gaasch), thanks to the precious help of Nuxien (Johan Roussel) and grosboulet.

Please be sure you don't email us telling this script is sh*t without mentioning
why and how you would improve it better (precise code example wanted) :) thank you ^^

This script has the following dependencies:
 * usual binutils, rsync, wget, mailx.
 * apache2-utils sharutils (debian packages for htpasswd and uuencode)
